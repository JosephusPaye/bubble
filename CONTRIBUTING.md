## Developing

### `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode, and rebuilds on changes.

### `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder. The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
